meningitis survive often without any after effects but sometimes these diseases cause a range of disabilities and problems that can alter people\\'s lives. after effects may be temporary or permanent physical or emotional. these include- 1) memory loss / difficulty retaining information / lack of concentration 2) clumsiness / co-ordination problems 3) residual headaches 4) deafness / hearing problems / tinnitus / dizziness loss of balance 5) learning difficulties (ranging from temporary learning deficiencies to long term mental impairment) 6) epilepsy / seizures (fits) 7) weakness paralysis or spasms of part of body (if permanent sometimes called cerebral palsy) <positive_smiley> speech problems 9) loss of sight/changes in sight. viral meningitis usually has a tendency for recurrence e. g. herpes simplex type ii meningitis. hope this helps. take care. note: this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for

\"you seem concerned by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you. two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy. emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy. the third trimester is the most anxious one. this is the period when mother-to-be worries about everything and anything that she can think of. however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general. you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general. it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy. however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner. you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder. a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby\\'s physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression. get treated with the right psychotherapy and medication for effective results. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide

troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson\\'s progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking \\'during\\' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post

function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on

get things done and did not eat. in the early evening i had a few glasses of wine with friends and reacted very badly becoming confused and feeling more intoxicated than usual. my behavior was not reflective of my usual behavior. i am wondering if i became hypoglycemic due to diet lack of food and then when i drank alcohol became more hypoglycemic. i am otherwise healthy and have never experienced this previously or after. the only difference was diet and not eating enough for a long period of time. having some wine is not unusual but the reaction was as was my

seem concerned by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you. two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy. emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy. the third trimester is the most anxious one. this is the period when mother-to-be worries about everything and anything that she can think of. however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general. you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general. it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy. however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner. you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder. a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby\\'s physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression. get treated with the right

further evaluation. visit your doctor/gynecologist at the earliest for thorough examination and further evaluation to look for the underlying cause. mammogram or ultrasound scan and tumor marker tests done will help to rule out/predict chances of cancer. you can try with warm compresses use of heating pad gentle massage etc to alleviate the pain. nurse your baby frequently and vary the positions to

there is always a small risk of delayed recurrence of leukemia with or without pregnancy). you should of course discuss your concerns with both your oncologist and your gynecologist before deciding to

about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child\\'s movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child\\'s ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the child\\'s present capabilities; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 examination of the child\\'s posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized \\'problem-solving\\' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of \\'key points\\' on the child\\'s body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical

function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function. but once the

recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson\\'s progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking \\'during\\' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md

consequences of the whipple operation include the following: 1. mal-absorption: the pancreas produces enzymes required for digestion of food. in some patients removal of part of the pancreas during the whipple operation can lead to a diminished production of these enzymes. patients complain of bulky diarrhea type of stool that is very oily. long-term treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation usually provides relief from this problem. 2. alteration in diet: after the whipple operation it is generally recommended that the patients ingest smaller meals and snack between meals to allow better absorption of the food and to minimize symptoms of feeling of being bloated or getting too full. 3. loss of weight: it is common for patients to lose up to 5 to 10% of their body weight compared to their weight prior to their illness. the weight loss usually stabilizes very rapidly and most patients after a small amount of initial weight loss are able to maintain their weight

palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child\\'s movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child\\'s ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the child\\'s present capabilities; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 examination of the child\\'s posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized \\'problem-solving\\' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of \\'key points\\' on the child\\'s body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this

nauseous over it since i want to tell them but the outcome will not be good. so i\\'m not going to tell them at all it\\'s safe to say i really love this boy because we both skype every night and we have since the end of june maybe early july. i am starting high school with him too. but since we are both so bus we don\\'t see each other so we skype. so basically what i need advice on is how to overcome my nauseous feeling and constant stress that i am getting from the whole thing. i haven\\'t really been able to eat or sleep much either from it. and i am going to be more active in school so

really doing this too soon and i should just wait. but i don\\'t want to break up with him because i feel like he won\\'t understand where i\\'m coming from and we won\\'t even be friends afterwards.

functional capabilities and disabilities when comparing whipple with the other surgeries like laparoscopic gall bladder removal. some of the long-term consequences of the whipple operation include the following: 1. mal-absorption: the pancreas produces enzymes required for digestion of food. in some patients removal of part of the pancreas during the whipple operation can lead to a diminished production of these enzymes. patients complain of bulky diarrhea type of stool that is very oily. long-term treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation usually provides relief from this problem. 2. alteration in diet: after the whipple operation it is generally recommended that the patients ingest smaller meals and snack between meals to allow better absorption of the food and to minimize symptoms of feeling of being bloated or getting too full. 3. loss of weight: it is common for patients to lose up to 5 to 10% of their body weight compared to their weight prior to their illness. the weight loss usually stabilizes very rapidly and most patients after a small amount of initial weight loss are able to maintain their weight and do well. hope this helps. take care. note:

of the function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on

pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you. two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy. emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy. the third trimester is the most anxious one. this is the period when mother-to-be worries about everything and anything that she can think of. however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general. you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general. it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy. however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner. you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder. a survey states that untreated emotional health problems

thanks\",\\n            \"it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called \\'nissen fundoplication\\'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery \\'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to \\'burp\\' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called \\'endoscopic fundoplication\\'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\",\\n            \"most gi illnesses don\\'t cause pain in one\\'s arm and so i would suggest that your doctors make sure that this pain you are experiencing is not related

child\\'s movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child\\'s ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the child\\'s present capabilities; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 examination of the child\\'s posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized \\'problem-solving\\' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of \\'key points\\' on the child\\'s body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\",\\n

are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements such as vitamin b12 vitamin d calcium iodine and omega-3 fatty acids. these deficiencies have potentially serious consequences including anemia rickets and cretinism in children and osteomalacia and hypothyroidism in adults. given the data that you provided of hypoglycemia hunger blurred vision of your left eye and weight loss it is likely that you experience them because your body is not adjusting to that diet and the low calorie intake. since you experience thyroid cancer the needs for energy are increased because the cancer causes the metabolism to work faster and to spend the energy faster. if the body doesn\\'t have enough energy it starts to lose in weight and hypoglycemia is the consequence. you may consider changing the diet back to normal or to increase the energy intake while still vegetarian but to take more vitamin mineral and omega-3 fatty acids supplements. please keep in mind that i

diet is a diet or lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food. properly planned vegan diets are healthful and have been found to satisfy nutritional needs. poorly planned vegan diets can be low in levels of calcium iodine vitamin b12 and vitamin d. vegans are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements such as vitamin b12 vitamin d calcium iodine and omega-3 fatty acids. these deficiencies have potentially serious consequences including anemia rickets and cretinism in children and osteomalacia and hypothyroidism in adults. given the data that you provided of hypoglycemia hunger blurred vision of your left eye and weight loss it is likely that you experience them because your body is not adjusting to that diet and the low calorie intake. since you experience thyroid cancer the needs for energy are increased because the cancer causes the metabolism to work faster and to spend the energy faster. if the body doesn\\'t have enough energy it starts to lose in weight and hypoglycemia is the consequence. you may consider changing the diet back to normal or to increase the energy intake while still vegetarian but to take more vitamin mineral and omega-3 fatty acids supplements. please keep in mind that i provide medical information only. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please contact your doctor or other healthcare

seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called \\'nissen fundoplication\\'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery \\'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to \\'burp\\' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called \\'endoscopic fundoplication\\'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\"\\n         ]\\n      },\\n

\"hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson\\'s progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking \\'during\\' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a

relations.\",\\n            \"it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.\"\\n

stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child\\'s movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child\\'s ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the child\\'s present capabilities; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 examination of the child\\'s posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized \\'problem-solving\\' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of \\'key points\\' on the child\\'s body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical

help you out. i can understand your concern for your uncle but the surgeon was absolutely right in abandoning the whipple\\'s procedure on seeing the metastasis to the liver. once the tumor has metastasized to the liver it becomes a stage 4 pancreatic cancer. unfortunately majority of the patients don\\'t live more than 6 months and only a few survive up to one year once the diagnosis is confirmed. the only option available presently is chemotherapy. i sincerely hope that helps. take care.\",\\n            \"the urge to urinate could suggest a presence of a lower urinary tract

want to consult your gp.\",\\n            \"it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.\"\\n

you need to inform your parents about it. the best way to do is go for a dilatation and curettage. vacuum evacuation can be tried before 7 weeks of pregnancy. if you do not want that then you can try a drug which contains a chemical called mifepristone. the best method through pills is a combination of mifepristone plus prostaglandin. discuss this with the gynecologist. i would suggest you consult a gynecologist if your pregnancy test is positive and not go for any pills on your own as they carry the danger of incomplete abortion and very heavy bleeding. a dose higher than the required dose can cause damage to the uterus too. so please do not self medicate. after the termination think in terms of inserting iud or other such devices like implanon or go for pills. please consult your

you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.\"\\n         ]\\n      },\\n      {\\n         \"tag\":\"headache\",\\n         \"patterns\":[\\n            \"my boyfriend decided

identifying any sequelae of meningitis suffered earlier. eye examination will show signs of increased intracranial pressure like optic disc edema. in an instance of raised intracranial pressure person

nasal congestion a loss in appetite or one may feel tired or run down. these symptoms may occur for a day or two before other manifestations of chicken pox. most children with chickenpox act sick with symptoms such as a fever headache tummy ache or loss of appetite for a day or two before breaking out in the classic pox rash. the outcome is generally excellent in uncomplicated cases. encephalitis

examination of the nose the throat and the lungs would be done. laboratory tests needed to detect the exact cause of the infection are likely to be performed too. since a common cold is usually caused by a virus the doctor might decide not to prescribe antibiotics and instead opt to wait and see. if the baby has a fever antipyretics would be recommended. if a bacterial cause is detected then adequate antibiotics would be given. the only specific thing about this is that not all antibiotics are recommended for babies. but do not worry. a -pediatrician whom you are advised would know what antibiotic is allowed to be given to your baby. a pump to take out the fluid from the nose would ease the baby\\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u0099s breathing. this would also help the baby to eat because a

given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.\",\\n            \"autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction. this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination. the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned. the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating others\\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u0099 words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures. repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize. it might include: compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self-injury. as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician. until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of 19 months whose speech is not fluent enough to

severe cases of chicken pox than young children. they usually have more sores run a temperature for longer and may experience some nausea. initial symptoms of chicken pox are usually ignored. one may have slight nasal congestion a loss in appetite or one may feel tired or run down. these symptoms may occur for a day or two before other manifestations of chicken pox. most children with chickenpox act sick with symptoms such as a fever headache tummy ache or loss of appetite for a day or two before breaking out in the classic pox rash. the outcome is generally excellent in uncomplicated cases.

co-ordination problems 3) residual headaches 4) deafness / hearing problems / tinnitus / dizziness loss of balance 5) learning difficulties (ranging from temporary learning deficiencies to long term mental impairment) 6) epilepsy / seizures (fits) 7) weakness paralysis or spasms of part of body (if permanent sometimes called cerebral palsy) <positive_smiley> speech problems 9) loss of

the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side

your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child\\'s movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child\\'s ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the patterns of movement the child presents with; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 the child\\'s present capabilities; \\\\u00e2\\\\u0080\\\\u00a2 examination of the child\\'s posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized \\'problem-solving\\' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements.

(gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called \\'nissen fundoplication\\'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery \\'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to \\'burp\\' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called \\'endoscopic fundoplication\\'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\",\\n            \"cerebral palsy is a condition in which certain of the muscles (most often in the extremities) are affected thus causing muscle weakness up to paralysis. this might cause a disability of a certain degree in the person which would interfere in the everyday life driving ability included. however there are many car modifications that might help people with a driving disability. in the beginning it might be best to visit a doctor who might be able to determine the degree of disability and the modifications needed. in different countries there are associations that try to improve the life of people with disabilities. they also organize driver rehabilitation programs run by driver rehabilitation specialists. you might want to check if there is such an association in your country. they also might be able to tell you about legal issues related to drivers with disabilities. as for the problems you are experiencing (difficulty in releasing the clutch and pressing the accelerator at the same time; the gear handling is also difficult with steering) it might be easily solved if you buy a car with an automatic transmission. this would eliminate the need for a clutch and a manual shift. the problem with the poor road sense might need training from a driving rehabilitation specialist.\"\\n         ]\\n      },\\n      {\\n         \"tag\":\"memory loss\",\\n         \"patterns\":[\\n            \"i have a meningitis last 2 years i just want to know whats

anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson\\'s progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking \\'during\\' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for

infection - increases the healing time. 4. disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site - also hampers healing 5. malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time. 6. early mobilization of the joint - before complete healing. in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery. without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis. i am sorry about that. but platelet rich plasma (prp) does contain important cytokines and growth

operation include the following: 1. mal-absorption: the pancreas produces enzymes required for digestion of food. in some patients removal of part of the pancreas during the whipple operation can lead to a diminished production of these enzymes. patients complain of bulky diarrhea type of stool that is very oily. long-term treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation usually provides relief from this problem. 2. alteration in diet: after the whipple operation it is generally recommended that the patients ingest smaller meals and snack between meals to allow better absorption of the food and to minimize symptoms of feeling of being bloated or getting too full. 3. loss of weight: it is common for patients to lose up to 5 to 10% of their body weight compared to their weight prior to their illness. the weight loss usually stabilizes very rapidly and most patients after a small amount of initial weight loss are able to maintain their weight and do well. hope this helps.

edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase. 3. infection - increases the healing time. 4. disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site - also hampers healing 5. malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time. 6. early mobilization of the joint - before complete healing. in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery. without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis. i am sorry about that. but platelet rich plasma (prp) does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing (bone formation in your case) and hence your recovery. as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress. hence if the fractured bone site heals completely (which will eventually happen in due

palsy is a condition in which certain of the muscles (most often in the extremities) are affected thus causing muscle weakness up to paralysis. this might cause a disability of a certain degree in the person which would interfere in the everyday life driving ability included. however there are many car modifications that might help people with a driving disability. in the beginning it might be best to visit a doctor who might be able to determine the degree of disability and the modifications needed. in different countries there are associations that try to improve the life of people with disabilities. they also organize driver rehabilitation programs run by driver rehabilitation specialists. you might want to check if there is such an association in your country. they also might be able to tell you about legal issues related to drivers with disabilities. as for the problems you are experiencing (difficulty in releasing the clutch and pressing the accelerator at the same time; the gear handling is also difficult with steering) it might be easily solved if you buy a car with an automatic transmission. this would eliminate the need for a clutch and a manual shift. the problem with the poor road sense might need training from a driving rehabilitation specialist.\",\\n            \"breast milk has no side effects and does not interfere with any medicines which you are

esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called \\'nissen fundoplication\\'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery \\'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to \\'burp\\' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called \\'endoscopic fundoplication\\'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\",\\n            \"if the upper and lower endoscopy were performed properly then the risk of colon rectal esophageal or gastric (stomach) cancer

(although there is always a small risk of delayed recurrence of leukemia with or without pregnancy). you should of course discuss your concerns with both your oncologist and your gynecologist before

are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take

still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take

              "    \"hi thanks for using the ehealth forum for your query. you seem concerned by the post meningitic sequelae or after effects of meningitis and the possibility of recurrence. most people who get meningitis survive often without any after effects but sometimes these diseases cause a range of disabilities and problems that can alter people's lives. after effects may be temporary or permanent physical or emotional. these include- 1) memory loss / difficulty retaining information / lack of concentration 2) clumsiness / co-ordination problems 3) residual headaches 4) deafness / hearing problems / tinnitus / dizziness loss of balance 5) learning difficulties (ranging from temporary learning deficiencies to long term mental impairment) 6) epilepsy / seizures (fits) 7) weakness paralysis or spasms of part of body (if permanent sometimes called cerebral palsy) <positive_smiley> speech problems 9) loss of sight/changes in sight. viral meningitis usually has a tendency for recurrence e. g. herpes simplex type ii meningitis. hope this helps. take care. note: this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.\"],\n",

              "    \"it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\",\n",

              "    \"you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: â\\x80¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with; â\\x80¢ age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; â\\x80¢ the child's present capabilities; â\\x80¢ examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\",\n",

              "    \"it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\"],\n",

              "    'it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.'],\n",

              "    \"you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: â\\x80¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with; â\\x80¢ age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; â\\x80¢ the child's present capabilities; â\\x80¢ examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\",\n",

              "    'it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.'],\n",
